__Includes 12 nvidia-smi results ran on AlexNet.__

The name of each file reflects number of GPUs and the batch size used for each test.
(ex. gpu2_batch32.csv : 2 GPUs, batch size 32)

Other variables other than the number of GPUs and the batch size are fixed as follows:
  - model = AlexNet
  - learning rate = 0.02
  - gpu = p40
  - cpus per task = 4
  - stop at iteration 15
